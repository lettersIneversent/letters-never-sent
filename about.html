                    <h2>The Beginning: How It All Started</h2>
                    <p>I was 15 when I met him. Young, hopeful, and completely unprepared for what would become an 8 year journey of waiting, hoping, and accepting crumbs.</p>
                    
                    <p>He was everything I thought I wanted charming, intelligent, emotionally unavailable (though I didn't see that red flag at the time). What started as a beautiful connection quickly became a pattern I couldn't break free from.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>He would text me late at night.</strong> Send me songs that felt like love letters. Say things like "you're my person" and "I've never felt this way about anyone." Then disappear for weeks, leaving me wondering what I did wrong.</p>
                    
                    <p>I told myself I was being patient. Understanding. That real love was worth waiting for.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>I was wrong.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <!-- The Long Wait -->
                <div class="story-section">
                    <h2>The 18 Year Wait: What I Accepted</h2>
                    <p>For 18 years, I made myself available for someone who couldn't make himself available for me. Here's what that looked like:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="story-list">
                        <li><strong>Mixed signals as communication:</strong> "I love you" followed by choosing someone else every single day</li>
                        <li><strong>Being his emotional safe space</strong> while he lived his real life elsewhere</li>
                        <li><strong>Accepting late-night texts</strong> that felt like promises but led absolutely nowhere</li>
                        <li><strong>Making excuses for his behavior</strong> while ignoring my own needs</li>
                        <li><strong>Waiting for "someday"</strong> while my actual life passed me by</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>During those 18 years, I built a whole life. I dated other people, had my daughter, and even entered a committed relationship. But I always kept that space in my heart for him always wondering "what if?"</p>
                    
                    <blockquote class="story-quote">
                        "The hardest truth? I genuinely believed he was supposed to be in my life forever. I never prepared for the possibility of him not being there. He was ALWAYS supposed to be here."
                    </blockquote>
                </div>

                <!-- The Breaking Point -->
                <div class="story-section">
                    <h2>The Breaking Point: When Everything Changed</h2>
                    <p>The breaking point wasn't another empty promise or mixed signal. It was a moment of clarity that hit me like a truck:</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>I was teaching my daughter, through my actions, not my words, that it's okay to wait for someone who won't choose you.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>That love means accepting crumbs.</p>
                    
                    <p>That your worth is determined by whether someone else can see it.</p>
                    
                    <p>In that moment, I realized I had two choices: keep waiting and modeling this pattern for my daughter, or finally choose myself.</p>
                    
                    <p>So at 2:30 AM on a Tuesday, I sent the text that changed everything.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- The Message -->
                <div class="story-section message-section">
                    <h2>The 2:30 AM Text That Set Me Free</h2>
                    <div class="message-box">
                        <p><em>"Maybe someday we'll figure this all out. Maybe we'll live without fear or doubt, and love each other openly, in a way that timing didn't allow before. Even if we can't fix everything now, I still wish for peace and understanding between us because some things are worth believing in, even from a distance.</em></p>
                        
                        <p><em>I love you, but I also love me and my daughter more. You may think what I've felt came from low self esteem but truly it's genuine love üíï all of it. I honestly thought you were the one for me, locked in for life ü§ûüèæ and it's crushing to realize but I can't have you halfway. I know we both have our demons and I have to get my stuff straight too. I've been fooled twice and maybe that's on me but this love? It's real. It's pure. It doesn't die.</em></p>
                        
                        <p><em>Still, I deserve to be treated like the queen I am fully, wholly, and without compromise. I'm also an example for my daughter hence my end needs clearing also but anyways... So yeah‚Ä¶ all love always will be ü•∞üòò but if you want a place in my heart now, you'll have to fight for it."</em></p>

                    <p>He read it. And never responded.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>That silence was my answer.</strong> Not cruel silence clarifying silence. It confirmed what I already knew but wasn't ready to accept.</p>

                    <h2>What I Learned: The Truth About Closure</h2>
                    <p>Here's what 8 years of waiting taught me:</p>
                    
                    <div class="lessons-grid">

                            <p>It's something you give yourself. I waited years for him to give me closure the right apology, explanation, or conversation. Real closure came when I decided I wouldn't wait anymore.</p>

                            <p>I told myself I was being "understanding" by accepting whatever he could give. But love that requires you to shrink, wait, or accept less isn't love, it's emotional convenience.</p>

                            <p>By accepting halfway love for 8 years, I taught him that's all he needed to give. The day I said, "I can't have you halfway," everything changed.</p>
